In this\nstudy, we explore several publicly available sentiment labeled datasets and\ndesigned classifiers using both classical and deep learning algorithms. In our\nstudy, the classical algorithms include SVM and Random Forest, and deep\nlearning algorithms include CNN, FastText, and transformer-based models. We\ncompare these models in terms of model performance and time-resource\ncomplexity. Our finding suggests transformer-based models, which have not been\nexplored earlier for Bangla, outperform all other models. Furthermore, we\ncreated a weighted list of lexicon content based on the valence score per\nclass. We then analyzed the content for high significance entries per class, in\nthe datasets. For reproducibility, we make publicly available data splits and\nthe ranked lexicon list. The presented results can be used for future studies\nas a benchmark."}, "authors": ["Md.

Recently, it was shown\nthat zone-wise recognition method improves the word recognition performance\nthan conventional full word recognition system in Indic scripts. Inspired with\nthis idea we consider the zone segmentation approach and use middle zone\ninformation to improve the traditional word spotting performance. To avoid the\nproblem of zone segmentation using heuristic approach, we propose here an HMM\nbased approach to segment the upper and lower zone components from the text\nline images. The candidate keywords are searched from a line without segmenting\ncharacters or words. Also, we propose a novel feature combining foreground and\nbackground information of text line images for keyword-spotting by character\nfiller models.

The method is evaluated on\nthree popular datasets of different handwritten Bangla characters and digits.\nThe implementation of the proposed methodology can be found in the following\nlink: https://github.com/DeepQn/GA-Based-Kernel-Size."}, "authors": ["Animesh Singh", "Sandip Saha", "Ritesh Sarkhel", "Mahantapas Kundu", "Mita Nasipuri", "Nibaran Das"], "author_detail": {"name": "Nibaran Das"}, "author": "Nibaran Das", "links": [{"href": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.12405v2", "rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html"}, {"title": "pdf", "href": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.12405v2", "rel": "related", "type": "application/pdf"}], "arxiv_primary_category": {"term": "cs.CV", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom"}, "tags": [{"term": "cs.CV", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "label": null}], "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.12405v2", "affiliation": "None", "arxiv_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.12405v2", "arxiv_comment": null, "journal_reference": null, "doi": null}

Most publicly available parallel corpora for Bengali are not\nlarge enough; and have rather poor quality, mostly because of incorrect\nsentence alignments resulting from erroneous sentence segmentation, and also\nbecause of a high volume of noise present in them. In this work, we build a\ncustomized sentence segmenter for Bengali and propose two novel methods for\nparallel corpus creation on low-resource setups: aligner ensembling and batch\nfiltering.

These clusters\nin turn help measure the similarity between the constituent words of a\npotentially candidate phrase using a vector space model and judge the\nsuitability of this phrase to be a MWE. In this experiment, we apply the\nsemantic clustering approach for noun-noun bigram MWEs, though it can be\nextended to any types of MWEs. In parallel, the well known statistical models,\nnamely Point-wise Mutual Information (PMI), Log Likelihood Ratio (LLR),\nSignificance function are also employed to extract MWEs from the Bengali\ncorpus. The comparative evaluation shows that the semantic clustering approach\noutperforms all other competing statistical models. As a by-product of this\nexperiment, we have started developing a standard lexicon in Bengali that\nserves as a productive Bengali linguistic thesaurus."}, "authors": ["Tanmoy Chakraborty", "Dipankar Das", "Sivaji Bandyopadhyay"], "author_detail": {"name": "Sivaji Bandyopadhyay"}, "author": "Sivaji Bandyopadhyay", "arxiv_comment": "25 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables, International Journal of Linguistics\n  and Language Resources (Lingvistic{\\ae} Investigationes), 2014", "links": [{"href": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.6122v1", "rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html"}, {"title": "pdf", "href": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.6122v1", "rel": "related", "type": "application/pdf"}], "arxiv_primary_category": {"term": "cs.CL", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom"}, "tags": [{"term": "cs.CL", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "label": null}], "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.6122v1", "affiliation": "None", "arxiv_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.6122v1", "journal_reference": null, "doi": null}

In contrast to keyword-based searching, the meaning of a\nquestion or query is important here and answers are ranked according to\nrelevance. It is very natural that there is almost no common word between the\nquestion sentence and the answer sentence. In this paper, an approach is\ndescribed to find out the semantically relevant answers in the Bengali dataset.\nIn the first part of the algorithm, a set of statistical parameters like\nfrequency, index, part-of-speech (POS), etc. is matched between a question and\nthe probable answers. In the second phase, entropy and similarity are\ncalculated in different modules. Finally, a sense score is generated to rank\nthe answers. The algorithm is tested on a repository containing a total of\n275000 sentences. This Bengali repository is a product of Technology\nDevelopment for Indian Languages (TDIL) project sponsored by Govt. of India and\nprovided by the Language Research Unit of Indian Statistical Institute,\nKolkata.

In contrast to keyword-based searching, the meaning of a\nquestion or query is important here and answers are ranked according to\nrelevance. It is very natural that there is almost no common word between the\nquestion sentence and the answer sentence. In this paper, an approach is\ndescribed to find out the semantically relevant answers in the Bengali dataset.\nIn the first part of the algorithm, a set of statistical parameters like\nfrequency, index, part-of-speech (POS), etc. is matched between a question and\nthe probable answers. In the second phase, entropy and similarity are\ncalculated in different modules. Finally, a sense score is generated to rank\nthe answers. The algorithm is tested on a repository containing a total of\n275000 sentences.

While numerous medical BNs have been\npublished, most are presented fait accompli without explanation of how the\nnetwork structure was developed or justification of why it represents the\ncorrect structure for the given medical application. This means that the\nprocess of building medical BNs from experts is typically ad hoc and offers\nlittle opportunity for methodological improvement. This paper proposes\ngenerally applicable and reusable medical reasoning patterns to aid those\ndeveloping medical BNs. The proposed method complements and extends the\nidiom-based approach introduced by Neil, Fenton, and Nielsen in 2000. We\npropose instances of their generic idioms that are specific to medical BNs. We\nrefer to the proposed medical reasoning patterns as medical idioms. In\naddition, we extend the use of idioms to represent interventional and\ncounterfactual reasoning.

It is well-known that speech\nsignals exhibit quasi-stationary behavior in and only in a short interval, and\nthe TCL method aims to exploit this temporal structure.

(Precise statement in the\npaper.) To the best of our knowledge this is the first time such a rate\nschedule has been successfully used, let alone for highly successful\narchitectures. As expected, such training rapidly blows up network weights, but\nthe net stays well-behaved due to normalization.\n  2. Mathematical explanation of the success of the above rate schedule: a\nrigorous proof that it is equivalent to the standard setting of BN + SGD +\nStandardRate Tuning + Weight Decay + Momentum. This equivalence holds for other\nnormalization layers as well, Group Normalization, LayerNormalization, Instance\nNorm, etc.\n  3. A worked-out toy example illustrating the above linkage of\nhyper-parameters. Using either weight decay or BN alone reaches global minimum,\nbut convergence fails when both are used."}, "authors": ["Zhiyuan Li", "Sanjeev Arora"], "author_detail": {"name": "Sanjeev Arora"}, "author": "Sanjeev Arora", "links": [{"href": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07454v3", "rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html"}, {"title": "pdf", "href": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.07454v3", "rel": "related", "type": "application/pdf"}], "arxiv_primary_category": {"term": "cs.LG", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom"}, "tags": [{"term": "cs.LG", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "label": null}, {"term": "stat.ML", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "label": null}], "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.07454v3", "affiliation": "None", "arxiv_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07454v3", "arxiv_comment": null, "journal_reference": null, "doi": null}

Furthermore, the more stable performance and better\ninterpretation of BNs make them viable options for practical query optimizers.\nOur experimental results on several single-relation and multi-relation\ndatabases indicate that BayesCard with a reasonable estimation time has a\nbetter estimation accuracy than deep learning models, and has from one to two\norders of magnitude less training cost nevertheless."}, "authors": ["Ziniu Wu", "Amir Shaikhha"], "author_detail": {"name": "Amir Shaikhha"}, "author": "Amir Shaikhha", "links": [{"href": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.14743v1", "rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html"}, {"title": "pdf", "href": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.14743v1", "rel": "related", "type": "application/pdf"}], "arxiv_primary_category": {"term": "cs.DB", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom"}, "tags": [{"term": "cs.DB", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "label": null}, {"term": "cs.LG", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "label": null}], "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.14743v1", "affiliation": "None", "arxiv_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.14743v1", "arxiv_comment": null, "journal_reference": null, "doi": null}

(2) IBN-Net can be applied to many advanced deep architectures,\nsuch as DenseNet, ResNet, ResNeXt, and SENet, and consistently improve their\nperformance without increasing computational cost. (3) When applying the\ntrained networks to new domains, e.g. from GTA5 to Cityscapes, IBN-Net achieves\ncomparable improvements as domain adaptation methods, even without using data\nfrom the target domain. With IBN-Net, we won the 1st place on the WAD 2018\nChallenge Drivable Area track, with an mIoU of 86.18%."}, "authors": ["Xingang Pan", "Ping Luo", "Jianping Shi", "Xiaoou Tang"], "author_detail": {"name": "Xiaoou Tang"}, "author": "Xiaoou Tang", "arxiv_comment": "Accepted for publication at ECCV 2018", "links": [{"href": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.09441v3", "rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html"}, {"title": "pdf", "href": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.09441v3", "rel": "related", "type": "application/pdf"}], "arxiv_primary_category": {"term": "cs.CV", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom"}, "tags": [{"term": "cs.CV", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "label": null}], "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.09441v3", "affiliation": "None", "arxiv_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.09441v3", "journal_reference": null, "doi": null}

Through the use of parameter\nreplacement and comparison, we demonstrate that reusability is different in\nBN(Batch Normalization)[7] layer and Convolution layer and some observations:\n(1)Running mean and running variance plays an important role than Weight and\nBias in BN layer.(2)The weight and bias can be reused in BN layers.( 3) The\nnetwork is very sensitive to the weight of convolutional layer.(4) The bias in\nConvolution layers are not sensitive, and it can be reused directly."}, "authors": ["Wei Wang"], "author_detail": {"name": "Wei Wang"}, "author": "Wei Wang", "arxiv_comment": "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2008.03411", "links": [{"href": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03414v1", "rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html"}, {"title": "pdf", "href": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.03414v1", "rel": "related", "type": "application/pdf"}], "arxiv_primary_category": {"term": "cs.CV", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom"}, "tags": [{"term": "cs.CV", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "label": null}, {"term": "cs.LG", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "label": null}, {"term": "eess.IV", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "label": null}], "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.03414v1", "affiliation": "None", "arxiv_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03414v1", "journal_reference": null, "doi": null}

Method: We replicate a study by McIntoshet. al that uses\nadditive regression to model the relationship between defects and code reviews.\nTo increase external validity, we apply the same methodology on a new software\nproject. We discuss our findings with the first author of the original study,\nMcIntosh. We then investigate how to reduce the impact of correlated predictors\nin the variable selection process and how to increase understanding of the\ninter-relationships among the predictors by employing Bayesian Network (BN)\nmodels. Context: As in the original study, we use the same measures authors\nobtained for Qt project in the original study. We mine data from version\ncontrol and issue tracker of Google Chrome and operationalize measures that are\nclose analogs to the large collection of code, process, and code review\nmeasures used in the replicated the study. Results: Both the data from the\noriginal study and the Chrome data showed high instability of the influence of\ncode review measures on defects with the results being highly sensitive to\nvariable selection procedure. Models without code review predictors had as good\nor better fit than those with review predictors.

We discuss our findings with the first author of the original study,\nMcIntosh. We then investigate how to reduce the impact of correlated predictors\nin the variable selection process and how to increase understanding of the\ninter-relationships among the predictors by employing Bayesian Network (BN)\nmodels. Context: As in the original study, we use the same measures authors\nobtained for Qt project in the original study. We mine data from version\ncontrol and issue tracker of Google Chrome and operationalize measures that are\nclose analogs to the large collection of code, process, and code review\nmeasures used in the replicated the study. Results: Both the data from the\noriginal study and the Chrome data showed high instability of the influence of\ncode review measures on defects with the results being highly sensitive to\nvariable selection procedure.

Finally, a series of\nexperiments are conducted to verify these claims."}, "authors": ["Jiacheng Sun", "Xiangyong Cao", "Hanwen Liang", "Weiran Huang", "Zewei Chen", "Zhenguo Li"], "author_detail": {"name": "Zhenguo Li"}, "author": "Zhenguo Li", "arxiv_comment": "Accepted by AAAI 2020", "links": [{"href": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09104v1", "rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html"}, {"title": "pdf", "href": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.09104v1", "rel": "related", "type": "application/pdf"}], "arxiv_primary_category": {"term": "cs.LG", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom"}, "tags": [{"term": "cs.LG", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "label": null}, {"term": "stat.ML", "scheme": "http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom", "label": null}], "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.09104v1", "affiliation": "None", "arxiv_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09104v1", "journal_reference": null, "doi": null}

We hypothesize that in certain cases it is desirable to relax its\nintrinsic generalization properties and introduce an extension of SGD called\ndeep gradient boosting (DGB). The key idea of DGB is that back-propagated\ngradients inferred using the chain rule can be viewed as pseudo-residual\ntargets of a gradient boosting problem. Thus at each layer of a neural network\nthe weight update is calculated by solving the corresponding boosting problem\nusing a linear base learner. The resulting weight update formula can also be\nviewed as a normalization procedure of the data that arrives at each layer\nduring the forward pass. When implemented as a separate input normalization\nlayer (INN) the new architecture shows improved performance on image\nrecognition tasks when compared to the same architecture without normalization\nlayers.
